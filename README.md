# 👋 Hi, I'm Aranck  

💻 Passionate about **building scalable backend systems** and **clean software architectures** that thrive in the real world.  
I specialize in **Spring Boot**, **Java**, and **REST APIs**, and I love connecting the backend to seamless **React** frontends.  

I’ve also worked with **MERN**, **FastAPI**, and **AI-driven agent systems**, managing data with **SQL** and **Supabase**.  
What excites me is creating solutions that are not just functional, but **robust, maintainable, and impactful**.
