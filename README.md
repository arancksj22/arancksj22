# üëã Hi, I'm Aranck  

Clean architecture, efficient code, and real-world-ready systems are what drive my approach to software engineering.  
I design **scalable backend solutions with Spring Boot** and its broader ecosystem, develop **RESTful APIs**, and integrate front-end interfaces using **React**.  

While this is my core stack, I also have competence with:  
- **MERN**  
- **FastAPI**  
- **AI agent systems**  
- **SQL & Supabase** for data management  

---

### üí° My Philosophy  
Collaborating with others to build systems that stand the test of time is fundamental to my work.  
The goal is to make them **easy to maintain**, **adaptable as needs evolve**, and **robust enough for real-world demands**.  

I find meaning in using technology thoughtfully to create solutions that make a **real difference** ‚Äî not just check boxes.  

---

### üöÄ What I'm Exploring  
- Backend design patterns & clean architecture  
- Workflow pipelines & system scalability  
- AWS-enabled applications  

---

### üèÜ Competitive Edge  
Fueled by competition, I regularly sharpen my skills through:  
- Coding problems & **LeetCode contests**  
- **Hackathons**  
- Championing **Java** as my weapon of choice
